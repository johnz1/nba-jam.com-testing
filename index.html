		This page lists all of the projects that I have released for the PlayStation 3 version of NBA JAM: On Fire Edition.  I started working on this game in early 2019.  The first project I released was "NBA JAM: Legends On Fire Edition" in March 2023.  This was the first mod ever released for NBA JAM: On Fire Edition.
		<br>
		<br>
		All of my projects are available for free.  There is no Patreon, GoFundMe, PayPal, Venmo, Cash App, or anything else.  You absolutely cannot send me money for my work on these projects.  If you find a way to send me money, I will decline it.

		<h1><u>Projects in Development</u></h1>
		<h2>NBA JAM: On Fire Edition Modding Guide</h2>
		This is a guide for how to mod NBA JAM: On Fire Edition for PS3. It details everything that I currently know how to do. It includes a large text document, image files, templates, spreadsheets, and an editor application.
		<br>
		Estimated release date: 2025
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>NBA JAM: 2010's On Fire Edition</h2>
		NBA JAM: 2010's On Fire Edition is a historical conversion mod featuring every franchise's best teams of the 2010's.
		<br>
		Estimated release date: 2025
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>NBA JAM: 2000's On Fire Edition</h2>
		NBA JAM: 2000's On Fire Edition is a historical conversion mod featuring every franchise's best teams of the 2000's.
		<br>
		Estimated release date: 2026
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>NBA JAM: Legends On Fire Edition v2.0</h2>
		More players.  More heads.  More customizations.
		<br>
		The new technical achievement in this release is that it uses the ATTRIBDB and textures from the last EA roster update in 2013 (rend_roster_update_big.ast). That means there are more players to replace (especially more skinny players, which are in high demand). Unfortunately, this severely shuffled the player models, so I had to go back to square one and re-do all the player model swaps.
		<br>
		Estimated release date: Unknown
		<br>
		<br>

		<br>
		<h1><u>Projects on Hold</u></h1>
		<h2>NBA JAM: Franchise Legends On Fire Edition</h2>
		As it is currently planned, NBA JAM: Franchise Legends On Fire Edition would feature the best players of the last four decades for every franchise. This would be similar to Legends On Fire Edition, but there would only be one team per franchise (just like stock OFE).
		<br>
		I want to create this project, but without the ability to edit ATTRIBDB, it is just too complex and too many compromises that have to be made. Until ATTRIBDB can be edited, I'm going to focus on the other projects I have in development.
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h1><u>How to Help</u></h1>
		The most important thing to figure out is how to read and edit ATTRIBDB (attribdb_big.ast). This will make most things far easier to change, and will open up many mod opportunities. Please see my description on the NLSC forum: <a href="https://forums.nba-live.com/viewtopic.php?f=72&t=116319">https://forums.nba-live.com/viewtopic.php?f=72&t=116319</a>
		<br>
		<br>
		Besides ATTRIBDB, here are the other things I'd like to be able to change:
		<br>
		- Edit the size and location of uniform numbers & letters
		<br>
		- Edit announcer audio
		<br>
		- Edit shot animations
		<br>
		- Change the color of team-controlled accessories
		<br>
		- Change the length of shorts (many players wear shorts are in between the game's two shorts lengths)
		<br>
		- Edit dunk animations
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>

		<h1><u>Frequently Asked Questions</u></h1>
		Q: Hold on a second...  I love NBA JAM.  Is this real?!
		<br>
		A: Yes.  It's real, it's free, and it's spectacular.
		<br>
		<br>
		Q: Is this a new game created by EA?
		<br>
		A: No, this is not a new game by EA.  This is a mod of NBA JAM: On Fire Edition.  You should own the original NBA JAM: On Fire Edition if you want to play this game.
		<br>
		<br>
		Q: How can I pay you or donate to this project?
		<br>
		A: This project is entirely and strictly free.  There is no Patreon or GoFundMe or PayPal.  You cannot send me money for this project.  Please just enjoy it :)
		<br>
		<br>
		Q: How long did it take to make this?
		<br>
		A: Took a long time, many hours.
		<br>
		<br>
		Q: Can you make a mobile/Android version?
		<br>
		A: No.  I have no interest in the NBA JAM mobile game, and I will not be modding it.
		<br>
		<br>
		Q: Can you make an Xbox 360 version?
		<br>
		A:  No.  While non-3D texture files are identical to the PS3 version, the 3D textures use a different file format (XPR instead of DDS).  If I wanted to create Xbox 360 versions of my OFE projects, it would require a parallel workflow for texture creation.  Unfortunately, that's a non-starter for me.
		<br>
		<br>
		Q: I need help getting this game to run.  Where should I go for troubleshooting help?
		<br>
		A: I recommend posting in the project's thread on the NLSC forum (nba-live.com).  That way, other people with the same questions/problems will be able to see the conversation.
		<br>
		<br>
		Q: How can I play this online?
		<br>
		A: This game is not playable on PSN.  I recommend using Parsec to play online.
		<br>
		<br>
		Q: I found something wrong with the game.  How can I report it to you?
		<br>
		A: Before contacting me, PLEASE read the entire release notes document.  You can report bugs by emailing me (<img src="images/email_address.png" alt="my email address is in the release notes of all my projects" style="vertical-align: text-bottom;">) or posting in this project's thread on the NLSC forum (nba-live.com).
		<br>
		<br>
		Q: Why have two of the main menu options been replaced with "----"?
		<br>
		A: These were online options that should not be used with this project.  Playing on a real PS3 could get you banned if you try to play online, so I want to do everything I can to discourage people from trying.
		<br>
		<br>
		Q: Why are there players with no profile photo and zeroes for all ratings?
		<br>
		A: Blank players were added to teams with only two players.  If a team only has two players, then you can't change which player you play as; player 1 will always be the player in the first slot and player 2 will always be the player in the second slot.  By adding a blank player, you can change which player you play as.
		<br>
		<br>
		Q: Why are the 3PT ratings so low?
		<br>
		A: In an attempt to balance the gameplay, the 3PT rating has an artificial maximum value of 8.
		<br>
		<br>
		Q: Why is Road Trip so hard?  I can't get a win!
		<br>
		A: In all of my projects, Road Trip is for expert players looking for a challenge (or something close to a challenge).  All the Road Trip matchups are set to the maximum difficulty ("Real AI").  I really didn't like how the original game's Road Trip was super easy when playing real NBA players, then got challenging when playing the fictional teams.  Keep playing exhibition games and increase the difficulty when you start winning.  You'll get better, and soon you'll be able to compete in Road Trip.
		<br>
		<br>
		Q: How can I unlock the bonus teams and players if I'm not good enough to beat the computer on "Real AI" difficulty?
		<br>
		A: The game gives you a nice little bonus (~15,000 credits and a bump to level 10) if you have a save game file from the 2010 NBA JAM game on your PS3.
